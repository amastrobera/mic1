# Computer System Architecture #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### Mic-1 architecture ###

The repo contains all files needed to build an IJVM program, as in http://www.ontko.com/mic1/user_guide.html

### What's in here ###

* two directories containing temporary programs: jas files (to edit) and ijvm files (assembled)
* two scripts to run ivjm or mic1 simulator
